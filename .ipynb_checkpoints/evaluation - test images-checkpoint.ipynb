    "The metric sweeps over a range of IoU thresholds, at each point calculating an F2 Score. The threshold values range from 0.5 to 0.95 with a step size of 0.05: (0.5, 0.55, 0.6, 0.65, 0.7, 0.75, 0.8, 0.85, 0.9, 0.95). In other words, at a threshold of 0.5, a predicted object is considered a \"hit\" if its intersection over union with a ground truth object is greater than 0.5.\n",

    "At each threshold value t, the F2 Score value is calculated based on the number of true positives (TP), false negatives (FN), and false positives (FP) resulting from comparing the predicted object to all ground truth objects. The following equation is equivalent to F2 Score when Î² is set to 2:\n",

The average F2 Score of a single image is then calculated as the mean of the above F2 Score values at each IoU threshold:\n",
